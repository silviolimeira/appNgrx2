Items Feature

Define state
src/app/reducers/items.ts. It extends from EntityState in @ngrx/entity.

Create Actions
$ mkdir -p src/app/actions
$ touch src/app/actions/items.ts

Create reducers
    After defining the state and actions, we can
create reducers. For each action defined, the reducer function
needs to have login to handle it.

Add effects
    The actual login of loading items is implemented in the effect.
$ mkdir -p src/app/effects/
$ touch src/app/effects/items.ts

$ npm install angularfire2 firebase --save
ref: https://medium.com/letsboot/lets-learn-how-to-install-and-setup-angularfire2-4-0-135d72bb0a41

With the effect loadItems$, the action Load triggers actions LoadSucess or LoadFial
NOte: It's convention for variables of Observables to use $ as the name suffix

Top Stories Feature

Create the State, 
    The State is similar to the state for items
    $ ionic g module modules/topStories
    $ ionic g class modules/top-stories/reducer/topStories

Create Action,
    $ ionic g class modules/top-stories/action/topStories

Create Reducer
    $ ionic g class modules/top-stories/reducer/topStories
    note: already created when state created

    Pagination
        create State and reducer function for Pagination

        $ ionic g class modules/top-stories/reducer/pagination

Create effects
    The last piece is the effect to load ids of top stories.
    
    $ ionic g class modules/top-stories/effect/topStories

*** The reducer functions only
deal with a subset of global state. The global state is
a hierarchical composition of states at different levels.
It's common to have the file index.ts in directory
reducers to compose the state for a module.

$ ionic g class modules/top-stories/reducer/index
